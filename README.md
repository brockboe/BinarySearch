# BinarySearch

This is just a simple binary search algorithm written by myself.
Feel free to use the code however you'd like. It takes an array
as argument. To use it in your own C code, simply add:

#include "binsearch.h"

to the top of your code and include binsearch.h and binsearch.c
to your working directory
